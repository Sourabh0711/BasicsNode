The Internet is a vast network that allows computers and devices around the world to communicate with each other.Data Transfer,Protocols,Servers and Clients,DNS (Domain Name System).
Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side. It comes with several core modules, each serving a specific purpose:http,fs,path,os,events,stream,crypto,util,url.
Relative Path: A path that is relative to the current working directory or the location of the file it’s being used in.
Absolute Path:A complete path that starts from the root of the file system or domain and leads directly to a specific file or directory.
Anonymous Functions: Anonymous functions are functions that are defined without a name. They are typically used in places where a function is needed but doesn’t need to be reused elsewhere.
What Does createServer Do: The createServer function in Node.js, part of the http module, is used to create a new HTTP server instance.Usage: This server listens for HTTP requests from clients, processes those requests (for example, by reading data or executing functions), and sends back a response. The function takes a callback as an argument, which gets executed every time a request is received.
What Does server.listen Do? Why Do We Need It: The server.listen function is used to start the HTTP server and make it listen for incoming requests on a specified port and hostname. Usage: Without server.listen, the server would not be running and wouldn’t be able to handle any requests. It essentially binds the server to a network address, so it can begin accepting connections.
Why We Need It: We need server.listen to explicitly tell the server to start listening for connections. This is crucial for any server-based application, as it dictates where the server will operate (e.g., on what port and IP address). Without it, the server wouldn't know where or how to accept incoming client requests.
